# Organize_Works.py
Just a simple personal project to practice OOP, clean code and connection with Databases

Start menu:

![Starting menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54481433/74450259-33b5e700-4e54-11ea-8052-c5d96f5459ae.PNG)

Of course each option leads to each respective function:
![Works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54481433/74450472-7f689080-4e54-11ea-9d4b-fb92a63659da.PNG)

And inside the functions of the start menu it has more functions like Add or delete works/tests:
![New Work_Test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54481433/74450492-87c0cb80-4e54-11ea-8461-7d6af26b477e.PNG)
![Delete Work_Test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54481433/74450505-8a232580-4e54-11ea-8f4c-84dfcc63fcf7.PNG)


The program allows you to Add, See and Delete works and tests, It doesn't have an GUI because it's just a simple project to practice what I've learned about Python and DB's
