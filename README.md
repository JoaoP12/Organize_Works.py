# Organize_Works.py
Just a simple personal project to practice OOP, clean code and connection with Databases

It has a start menu:
![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.png?raw=true "Starting menu")

Of course each option leads to each respective function:
![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.png?raw=true "Works")
![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.png?raw=true "Tests")

And inside the functions of the start menu it has more functions like Add or delete works/tests:
![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.png?raw=true "New Work_Test")
![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.png?raw=true "Delete Work_Test")
